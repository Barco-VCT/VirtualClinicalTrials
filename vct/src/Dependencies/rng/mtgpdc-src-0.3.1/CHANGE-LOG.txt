-------
Fix bug in mtgp64dc. bug:All tempering parameters searched by mtgp64dc were
zeros.

ver. 0.3
-------
A small bug in search_temper.hpp is fixed.  The bug effects only on
the least significant 5 bits, but it makes the dimension of
equidistribution of the LSBs smaller than they should be.

In addition, we modified the algorithm of searching tempering
parameters, so that the algorithm tempers the dimensions of
equidistribution of LSBs too, in addition to those of MSBs.  This is
to address a report on some statistical tests of these LSBs due to
Jonathan Passerat-Palmbach, David R.C. Hill and Claude Mazel.  We
thank them.

ver. 0.2
-------
a bug in the get_range functon in random_util.hpp is fixed.
a bug of delete operator in mt19937.hpp is fixed.
shortest_basis.hpp is changed not to use boost::ptr_vector.
allow large MEXP 110503 and 216091
